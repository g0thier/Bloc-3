# Bloc n¬∞3 : Analyse pr√©dictive de donn√©es structur√©es par l'intelligence artificielle.

## Video explain

* Foo

## Goals
### Walmart Sales
 * Part 1 : make an EDA and all the necessary preprocessings to prepare data for machine learning
 * Part 2 : train a linear regression model (baseline)
 * Part 3 : avoid overfitting by training a regularized regression model

### Conversion Rate Challenge
 * Part 1 : make an EDA and the preprocessings and train a baseline model with the file *data_train.csv*
 * Part 2 : improve your model's f1-score on your test set (you can try feature engineering, feature selection, regularization, non-linear models, hyperparameter optimization by grid search, etc...)
 * Part 3 : Once you're satisfied with your model's score, you can use it to make some predictions with the file *data_test.csv*. You will have to dump the predictions into a .csv file that will be sent to Kaggle (actually, to your teacher/TA ü§ì). You can make as many submissions as you want, feel free to try different models !
 * Part 4 : Take some time to analyze your best model's parameters. Are there any lever for action that would help to improve the newsletter's conversion rate ? What recommendations would you make to the team ?

### Uber Pickups.
 * Create an algorithm to find hot zones
 * Visualize results on a nice dashboard
